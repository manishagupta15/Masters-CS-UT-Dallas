What is the proxy design pattern?
- provide a class which will limit access to another class
- you may do this for security reasons, because an object is
	intensive to create , or is accessed from a remote location
============================
- The Proxy design pattern limits access to just the methods you 
	want made accessible in another class.

- It can be used for security reasons, because an Object is 
	intensive to create, or is accessed from a remote location. 
	You can think of it as a gate keeper that blocks access to 
	another Object.
