What is abstract factory pattern?
- It is like a factory pattern, but everything is encapsulated
	- The method that orders the object
	- The factories that build the object
	- The final object
	- the final objects contain objects that use the strategy pattern 
		- Strategy use composition: Object class fields are objects
		
What can we do with Abstract Factory Pattern?
- Create families of related objects without specifying a concrete class
- Use when you have many objects that can be added, or changed dynamically during runtime
- You can model anything you can imagine and have those objects interact through interfaces
- The bad thing is it can get complicated
