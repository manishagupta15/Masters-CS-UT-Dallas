The Factory Pattern allows you to create objects without 
specifying the exact class of object that will be created

When to use a factory pattern?
- When  you don't know ahead of time what class object you need
- When all of the potential classes are in the same class hierarchy 
- To centralize class selection code
- When you don't want the user to have to know every subclasses
- To encapsulate object creation
