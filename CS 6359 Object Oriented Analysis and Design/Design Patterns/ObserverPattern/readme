When to use the observer pattern?
- When you need many other objects to receive an update 
  when another object changes
		- stock market with thousands of stocks needs to send updates to
		objects representing individual stocks
		- the Subject  (Publisher) sends many stocks to the Observers
		- The Observers (Subscribers) takes the one that they want and use them
		
		
What is the benefit?
- loose coupling is a benefit
	- The subject (publisher) does'nt need to know anything about the 
	Observer (Subscriber) 
	
	
- Negative: The Subject (publisher) may send updates that dont matter to
 the Observer (Subscriber)
