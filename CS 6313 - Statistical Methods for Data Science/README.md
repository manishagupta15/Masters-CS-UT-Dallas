## CS 6313 - Statistical Methods for Data Science
Term : Spring '19

Instructor: Dr. Min Chen

Required Text: Probablity and Statistics for Computer Scientists, 2nd edition, Michael Baron

### Homework 1
Read Chapters 1 to 4 of the textbook to review the pre-requisite materials. Especially read the following sections: 2.1-2.4, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3.1-3.3.7, 3.4, 4.1-4.3
Solve the following exercises from the textbook
2.14, 3.7, 3.21, 3.37, 4.4, 4.6, 4.9, 4.23, 4.29, 4.31

### Homework 2
Textbook: Read Chapter 5 of the textbook. Especially read the following sections: 5.1, 5.2.1-5.2.3, 5.2.6, 5.3
Solve the following exercises from the textbook:
5.1, 5.2, 5.6, 5.7-c, 5.7-d, e (only for the oil filter problem), 5.8

Solutions will be provided for these problems. R code will also be provided for the last two problems.

### Homework 3
Textbook:
Read all of Chapter 8 of the textbook. 
Solve the following exercises from the textbook:
8.1 (b, c), 8.2, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7, 8.8 

Additional exercise:
Simulate a large number of draws (say, N=5,000) from a normal distribution with mean 5 and variance 4. Calculate the 97.5-th percentile of the draws. You should get a value that is close to 5 + 1.96*2= 8.92. Are you surprised at the finding? Why or Why not?

SimpleR.pdf:
Read Section 7 of simpleR.pdf (available on eLearning), and do the problems on pages 51-54. You may ignore the materials and problems involving normal probability plots for the time being. Use the more general ‘replicate’ function instead of the specialized ‘simple.sim’ function that the book proposes. The solutions will not be provided for these problems, but you must work on them to gain proficiency in R.
